# What is chocolatey ? <a name="#paragraph1"></a>
Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows that builds on top of existing Windows technologies, using NuGet for packaging.
 A package manager, for those not familiar, is a way to get software into your machine without much work on your part. It is the Windows equivalent of yum, apt-get for Linux or brew for Mac OS.  
Chocolatey helps you downloading applications from their official repositories and then installs, upgrades and configures them smoothly on your machine.
The real power of Chocolatey package manager is not in installing packages, it is really in the ability to keep them up to date.
For example, if you want to upgrade some software on your machine due to security reasons, you can do it easily as we’ll see in this article.

# How to install Chocolatey ? <a name="#paragraph2"></a>
First of all please open your powershell as admin, then execute these following commands

```sh
# Get-ExecutionPolicy
```
If it returns Restricted then run:

```sh
# Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned
```
Let's run the installation command, copy and paste it in your powershell:
```sh
# Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
Restart powershell and verify installation:
```sh
# choco -? 
```
If you want more details about installation, please visit their official [Installation Guide](https://chocolatey.org/install).  
Now let's play with some commands.

Managing software automatically can be harmful if not performed in proper way.
So it would be smarter to run a test to take a look on what would have happened, the chocolatey has some parameters to do that.


### Using whatif flag:  
Each choco command has a switch called -whatif. If it is used with a choco command, Chocolatey won't actually perform the action but inform you what would have happened.
```sh
# choco upgrade all -whatif

Chocolatey v0.10.15
